Average Wait Time: Displays the average time customers spend in the queue before speaking with an agent, helping managers monitor and manage service levels.

First Call Resolution Rate: Measures the percentage of customer issues resolved during the initial call, indicating the effectiveness of agents and processes in addressing customer needs promptly.

Customer Satisfaction Scores: Presents customer feedback ratings and sentiment analysis to gauge overall satisfaction levels and identify areas for improvement.

Agent Performance: Provides insights into individual agent performance metrics such as call handling time, call resolution rates, and customer satisfaction scores, facilitating performance evaluation and coaching opportunities.

Call Outcome Analysis: Breaks down call outcomes into categories such as resolved, escalated, or unresolved, enabling managers to understand the reasons behind call resolutions and take proactive measures to address recurring issues.
